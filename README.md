# Node.js Virus
Simple Node.js virus that encrypts all the files in its directory. Of course you can change it to any other directory in `index.js` file.

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/talentlessguy/nodejs-virus
cd nodejs-virus
npm init -y
npm i recursive-readdir
npm i -g pkg
```


## Usage
Go to `test` directory and run index.js file. Files will be encrypted.
To decrypt, go back to root directory and run `password.js`, it will output the password. Copy it, then run `decrypt.exe` ( in `test`) and insert the password there. Your files will be decrypted.
