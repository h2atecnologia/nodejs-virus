# Node.js Virus
Simple Node.js virus that encrypts all the files in its directory. Of course you can change it to any other directory in `index.js` file

## Usage
Go to `test` directory and run index.js file. Files will be encrypted.
To decrypt, go back to root directory and run `password.js`, it will output the password. Copy it, then run `decrypt.exe` ( in `test`) and insert the password there. Your files will be decrypted.
